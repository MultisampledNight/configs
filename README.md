It's dangerous out there, take this!

## What in the name of
These are most of my configuration files. Copy and paste out of them as much as you want, but mostly it really pays out if you read the manpages/helppages of the programs as well.

## About readability
These are partly about just having my configuration files backed up somewhere and partly about letting others use my configs if they want to. So I try to make it readable, but... on my own way.

## About updating
I doubt that I will update these very often. My config lives with me, and I change it as I need to.
