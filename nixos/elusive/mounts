# vim: noet ts=32
# describes all mounts which are shared between host and guest
#
# access kinds
# - rw: guest can write, changes from guest are visible to host
# - ro: guest cannot perform changes whatsoever
#
# there's no way to do rw, but host unable to observe changes
# well there is, with overlayfs, but in that case the host is unable to do changes itself
# would be kinda nice with caches like ~/.cargo but eh
#
# access  path	tag
